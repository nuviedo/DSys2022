# Introduction
The following project documents the practical application of several methods of dynamic systems to obtain and represent an accurate prediction of the population with either overweight or obesity found in México, through the analysis of results from the [_Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública_](https://insp.mx/) (National Public Health Institute | INSP) by making use of their various census reports to obtain the initial conditions required for said systems, through the usage of regression & extrapolation in several capacities be it linear polynomial or exponential, all the while making use of modern data science libraries.

The need for such a project stems from a simple hypothesis: given that the population that presents some kind of overweight or obesity is in and of itself a population, it is not too far a stretch to assume said population may follow a classical linear/exponential growth scenario. It is important to mention that gathering an accurate method of prediction for population under such conditions could help the relevant authorities improve their current health plans, comparing their expected results to our predicted models.


# General Objective
The expected output of this project is a set of graphs which predict, in the broadest terms, how the population with either of the aforementioned conditions can plausibly evolve, once iterated enough.
Said graphs are to be obtained through the use of concise graphing APIs, showcasing both the model being presented and the calculated precision by using an appropriate correlation coefficient between the estimated and known data, such that we can compare our approaches with eachother. It should be noted that the amount of data we can gather is considerably small, so it is expected we will not have real data to compare against that is not already present in the initial conditions.

#Toolset
The project is expected to be developed making use of several python 3.10+ libraries, such as the following:

* NumPy: "The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python"
* pandas: "An open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language"
* seaborn: "A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib, which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics."
* scipy: "Fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python"}
* scikit-learn: "Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib"
