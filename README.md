# Introduction
The following project documents the practical application of several methods of dynamic systems to obtain and represent an accurate prediction of the population with either overweight or obesity found in México, through the analysis of results from the [_Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública_](https://insp.mx/) (National Public Health Institute | INSP) by making use of their various census informs to obtain the initial conditions required for said systems, through the usage of regression & extrapolation in several capacities, be it linear polynomial or exponential, making use of modern data science libraries.

The need for such a project stems from a simple hypothesis: given that the population that presents some kind of overweight or obesity is in and of itself a population, it is not too far a stretch to assume said population may follow a classical linear/exponential growth scenario. 


# Objectives
The expected output of this project is a set of graphs which predict, in the broadest terms, how the population with either of the aforementioned conditions can plausibly evolve, once iterated enough.
Said graphs are to be obtained through the use of concise graphing APIs, showcasing both the model being presented and the calculated precision by using an appropriate correlation coefficient between the estimated and known data.
